## Project Outline:

Restock is a full stack web app to keep inventory of household items for multiple households using a Flask backend for CRUD operations on a MySQL database and a Jinja2 frontend for dynamic html pages.

Restock keeps track of what Household Items are running low in Households and lets Household Members know exactly what they need to get on their next run to the Stores. Household Members can create, read, update, and delete Household Inventory from a list of Household Items for their home. Each Household Member can view a list of Item Types found in each store in order to find items to restock. Items cannot be found in Stores directly. When it comes time to go for a restocking run, Household Members will need to search through Item Types of the Stores theyâ€™re shopping. Item Types are categorized as one of 10 different types such as cleaning supplies, toiletries, and groceries.
